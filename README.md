**NOTE:-** 
<br>
 You Will have to Manually go to the settings for the app by going to
 <br>
 Your Phones Settings App > Apps > FetchDroid > Permissions > Location and Select "Allow all the time"
 <br>
 This is due to Androids...sorry...GOOGLES api policies that don't allow third party apps this permission
 Funny cause their own CLOSED SOURCE apps have these permissions by default.


**Why FetchDroid**
1. Works without Mobile Data or Wifi
2. Is open source and very privacy friendly as everything is processed on your phone..EVERYTHING!
3. Very lightweight and Simple as fck

**How Does It Work?**
<br>
To use FetchDroid , you will have to first set the CodeWord , 
which when sent via any number to your when
will receive an sms reply with
<br> <br>
  **1**. coordinates
<br>
  **2**. a google maps link
<br>
  **3**. Wifi networks near your phone for better locating.

<br>

**How does it Actually Work??**
<br><br>
FetchDroid uses normal GPS , the signals emitted from satellites and
A-GPS (Assisted GPS) which is basically Cell tower data , nearby Wi-Fi networks ,Bluetooth beacons (indoors),Sensor fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)
to generate your latitude and longitude coordinates with up to 16 meters of accuracy ,all without connecting to WiFi or Data
