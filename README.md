**NOTE:-** 
<br>
 You Will have to Manually go to the settings for the app by going to
 <br>
 Your Phones Settings App > Apps > FetchDroid > Permissions > Location and Select "Allow all the time"
 <br>
 This is due to Androids API policies that don't allow third party apps this permission.


## **Why FetchDroid**
1. Works without Mobile Data or Wifi
2. Is open source and very privacy friendly as everything is processed on your phone..EVERYTHING!
3. Very lightweight and Simple as fck

## How Does It Work?
<br>
After Installing you need to set a codeword , 
<br>
this is like a password for finding your phone
<br>
after setting this code word , just close the app.
<br><br>
Whenever you lose your device , 
<br>
just send an SMS message to your phone/number with the codeword.
You'll get
<br><br>

- Coordinates
- Google maps link
- Nearby WiFi Names
 

<br>

## How does it Actually Work??
<br>
FetchDroid uses normal GPS , the signals emitted from satellites and
A-GPS (Assisted GPS) which is basically Cell tower data , nearby Wi-Fi networks ,Bluetooth beacons (indoors),Sensor fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)
to generate your latitude and longitude coordinates with up to 16 meters of accuracy ,all without connecting to WiFi or Data
